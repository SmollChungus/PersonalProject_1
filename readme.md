Simple Pomodoro app inside the terminal, made with Python and curses.
![App](https://i.imgur.com/CqrMJkZ.png)

Make sure the following modules are installed and up to date:

curses

For Windows installation: pip install windows-curses

To run the program, navigate to the root folder of the app inside terminal window.
Then run: python main.py


Currently something is going on with the arrow buttons, please run in terminal directly.
I think keycodes for arrows differ per interpreter(?) curses.KEY_UP = 250 in terminal and 456 in VSCode(?)

Few bugs that need to be solved still.

Thanks for the feedback!
