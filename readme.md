Simple Pomodoro app inside the terminal, made with Python and curses.

Make sure the following modules are installed and up to date:

curses

For Windows: pip install windows-curses



Currently something is going on with the arrow buttons, please run in terminal directly.
I think keycodes for arrows differ per interpreter(?) curses.KEY_UP = 250 in terminal and 456 in VSCode(?)

Few bugs that need to be solved still.

Thanks for the feedback!
